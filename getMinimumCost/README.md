# Greedy Florist Problem (HackerRank) - JavaScript Solution

## Problem Description

A group of friends want to buy all the flowers in a shop.  
Each flower `i` has a cost `c[i]`.

However, the florist increases the price of flowers based on how many flowers each friend has already purchased.  
If a friend has already bought `x` flowers, the next flower they buy costs `(x + 1) * original_price`.

You must find the **minimum total cost** to buy all flowers.
