# Fair Rations (HackerRank)

## Problem Description

You are given an array `B`, where each element represents the number of loaves of bread each person has in a line.  
You can only distribute bread **in pairs** — when you give one loaf to a person, you must also give one to their **immediate neighbor** (either left or right).

Your goal is to ensure **everyone ends up with an even number of loaves**.

If it is possible, print the **minimum number of loaves** that must be distributed.  
If it’s impossible, print **"NO"**.
