# Cavity Map (HackerRank)

## Problem Description

You are given a square grid map of positive digits. Each cell represents the depth at that point.  
We define a *cavity* as a cell that is **strictly deeper than all of its adjacent cells** (up, down, left, right).

You must replace each cavityâ€™s value with an `'X'` character and return the resulting map.
