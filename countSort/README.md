# ðŸ§® Count Sort (String Replacement Version)

## ðŸ“˜ Description
This program implements a **custom version of Counting Sort** in JavaScript.  
It sorts and organizes string elements based on numeric keys while replacing the first half of the input strings with a dash (`"-"`).  

This algorithm is inspired by the **"Full Counting Sort"** problem from HackerRank.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

### Step-by-step Explanation:
1. **Input**:  
   The function takes an array of pairs (subarrays), where:  
   - The **first element** is a numeric key (string form of an integer).  
   - The **second element** is a string value.  
   Example:  
   ```js
   [
     ["0", "ab"],
     ["6", "cd"],
     ["0", "ef"],
     ["6", "gh"]
   ]
