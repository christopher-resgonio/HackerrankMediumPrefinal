# ðŸ“Š Find the Median â€” HackerRank Solution

## ðŸ“˜ Description
This program solves the **"Find the Median"** problem from HackerRank.  
It sorts a list of integers and returns the **middle element** (median).

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works
1. Sort the array in ascending order.
2. Find the index in the middle of the sorted list.
3. Return the element at that index.

> Note: In this HackerRank problem, the list always has an **odd number of elements**, so we return a single integer â€” no averaging needed.
